## ToTCorrection

Any fil can be run which has a tpx3 header

Please run first:

ToTFlatMain
- Set the right directory
- set a filename (needs to have a _ on the end, but don' add it)
- make sure the filename has a numbering system with 6 numbers

- Set the ammount of files with a starting number (NOT 0)
- set an end number 
- you can add files to skip in the code (I should change that)

This creates a standard run.

If you save the ToT_FF_T_BIG2 matrix you can run from normalise curve
